# Discord Bots

I developed several discord bots over the last years.
I will not list them all here since a lot were developed for small personal reason or just as a joke.
However, I have two bots, which serve greater cause, which I will present you here.

One is the [Reputation Bot](reputation_bot.md), which aims to provide an alternative level system to the common chat message activity metrics.

The second bot is [Lyna](lyna.md), my newest bot, which serves as a download proxy and license management tool for my paid minecraft plugins.
