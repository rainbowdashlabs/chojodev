Schematic Tools was born from [survival schematic brush](survival_schematic_brush.md).
It should provide an alternative way to give access to schematics by giving away tools which can only paste specific schematics.
The plugin allows to limit usage of the tools by usage amount and permissions.

The tools can be in general used by builders as well to quickly organize their paste tools and store them in a persistent way, e.g. inventory templates.
