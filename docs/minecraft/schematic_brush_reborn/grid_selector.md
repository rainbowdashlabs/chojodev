Grid selector was created to allow simple creation of schematics and directly use them as a brush.

Builder usually generate some kind of grid and build there schematics inside this grid to export them into schematics
later.
Grid selector follows this approach by generating a grid and allows builders to directly select fields on that grid to
be used inside a schematic brush.
Once selected schematic can also directly be exported into persistent schematics instead of just being temporary available.
