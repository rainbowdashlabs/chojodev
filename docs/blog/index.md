# Chojos Dev Blog

Welcome on my blog.
That's my place where I relieve some steam or just want to share some knowledge,

I might write about a lot of random stuff.
Stuff which might affected me during my day, or just to keep answers on every day questions at some place.
So you might find all kinds of stuff, from infrastructure over programming or just some rants.
