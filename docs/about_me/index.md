# Hello I am Chojo

You probably came here to learn something about me. Well lets start it!

You often find me using the names Chojo, Hadde or Lilly when I am somewhere around in the internet (Except on GitHub for no reason).
I am passionate about Java and SQL (yes...).
Also like nearly everyone I want to do more stuff than I have time left.
I mainly work on minecraft plugins published under my [Eldoria](https://github.com/eldoriarpg) organisation. 
Feel free to check it out. 
All my work is open source since I think it is important to share knowledge and skills. 
I also created a bunch of tutorials, which teach you how to work with databases.
Check it out on my [repositories](https://github.com/rainbowdashlabs?tab=repositories).


If you are looking for a long story take a look at my [about me](my_story.md).
An overview about the [technologies](technologies.md) I use can be found here as well.
I also compiled a small list of [milestones](milestones.md).

If you want to contact me you can do this via `mail [at] chojo [dot] dev` or via my Discord Server.
