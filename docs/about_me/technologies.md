PlPGSQL is the SQL dialect of my choice, when I can choose my database.
I have several years of experience using it and know its strength and issues.

### SQL

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

I know the SQL standard quite well and have used it in many projects.
I also know the difference between plain SQL which is used by SqLite and the SQL variant used by MySQL and MariaDB, which differn in the feature set as well.

### Python

**Confidence:** ★★★⯪☆

Python is my main language when it comes to data analytic tasks and also data retrieval from external sources.

I develop and maintain several applications using python, and I am fond with a good amount of frameworks.

**Confidence:** ★★⯪☆☆

I can say at least that I understand the concept of NodeJS.
I wrote several smaller application with it.
I also used it for quickly developing scripts before I switched to python

## Software

Here is an incomplete list of software I use. The confidence here is mainly set on configuration of the software and
not the pure usage.

### Postgres

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

PlPGSQL is the SQL dialect of PostgreSQL, the database of my choice.
I have realised several projects with it, and I am fond in knowledge of its features and capabilities.

### MariaDB / MySQL / SqLite

**Confidence:** ★★★⯪☆

I have used MariaDB and Mysql to an extent where I can confidently say that I know its capabilities and caveats.
I also realised several projects which support MariaDB/MySQL/SqLite and PostgreSQL at the same time.

### Docker

**Confidence:** ★★★★☆

I use docker for all my projects. Besides I use some larger frameworks for monitoring and maintaining my infrastructure.

#### Technologies

I use various tool in connection to docker. Some of them are listed here:

All my documentations and webpages are generated with this software.

### GitHub (Workflows)

**Confidence:** ★★★★⯪

My whole deployment and development of my private project depends on GitHub and its workflows in combination with
docker images.
I use it heavily and could not live without it anymore
