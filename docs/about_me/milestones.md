# Milestones

On this page you will find several milestones on my way to what I am today.
Those might not be always in the exact right order, but I will try to be as exact as possible.
If you expect this to be a dry list of programming achievement this is probably the wrong place.
There is much more which brought me where I am today, than pure technical achievements.

## 1995 Birth

I was born.
Not really an achievement of myself, but I guess it is quite necessary for the other achievements to come.
So yeah.
Now I am here and finally ready to become a programmer.
Well not quite yet...

## 1999 First Console

I discovered the GameBoy of my grandma in the restroom closet.
Equipped with Tetris I started my first steps into the world of games, spending hours and hours on the restroom.
Later I started Pokémon Yellow, but since I couldn't read yet, my success was... not existent?
Further consoles followed like my first GameBoy Advance, which I got from some rando on a second hand market.

## 2002 School starts

School started and I got in my first contact with Anime.
Namely, YuGiOh, Pretty Cure and Digimon of course!
We didn't have a TV, so I visited my friends to watch them together.
Funny times. Good times.

## 2005 Nintendo DS Era

School heavily interfered with my desire to play Animal Crossing and Pokémon on my new Nintendo DS.
Not to mention my passion for Mario Kart with friends, which I have till today.
Still no desire to make those things myself.
On my Nintendo DS followed the Lite and 3DS Version.

## 2010 My first pc

With reaching Level 14 a fortune even called Confirmation (A church Ritual at 14) praised me with a bunch of money.
It was finally time and I were able to purchase my first own pc.
For school purposes of course!
So we went to the store and bought one of the shelf.
The first game on it?
Minecraft of course!
It was not much, but it was a pc, and it was even able to play Skyrim two years later!

## 2012 Skyrim

With Skyrim my love for big worlds and good stories was born.
But not only that.
Minecraft made good progress and as everyone I dreamed of owning a big server back then.
So what I did was of course renting a cheap gameserver at Nitrado.
Spending my hard-earned money on PaySafe cards to pay the bills.
Of course this failed, and the server got destroyed several times.
But it were funny times and I probably learned a lot.
First touches on configuration of a server, although not very technical.
And a new dream was born: One day I will develop my own plugins.

## 2014 Time to learn Java?

Yeah, we all have dreams.
And since especially young people like to talk about them, I told a friend that I want to learn how to program stuff for
minecraft aka java.
She lent me a book, which I probably kept till today.
Sorry for that.
It was the all famous "java island" book ("Java is auch eine Insel" in german).
Full of motivation I started... and stopped after 20 pages...
Guess every success starts with a failure.
My dreams put aside I focused on something new

## 2014 The MMORPG Years

School of course, my parents thought.
But no it was my MMORPG phase.
I started playing tera.
1 year before my high school graduation.
Of course, it was a good idea.
I learned a lot during that time.
Get to know new people of which some are important to me till today.
So while others spend hours on learning I spend hours on learning... boss fights.
It was a fun time, but also probably one of my biggest failures in school.

## 2015 Graduation and move to Berlin

Eventually I still managed to graduate.
Not as good as one would want, but I got my sheet of paper, which no one cares about anyway after studying.
"So what now."
That's probably what a lot of us thought.
My thoughts were just:
"Lets go to Berlin"
"Why Berlin?" one would probably ask.
It was the only city where I already knew some people.
I went there before and had a quite established group of people around me.
What to do there?
Not sure, so I volunteered for a year.

## 2015 Volunteer Year

During my volunteer year I taught old people what the internet is and why "I did nothing" is not a valid excuse for
adware on a pc.
This filled one year quite fast and while I worked there at the day I still followed another dream.
My dream from 2010. Yes, the minecraft server.
In the past years I never gave up on this and playing Minecraft was a constant joy in my days.
So I started to plan our my server once more.
I designed a world, plot, market system and much, much more, filling more than 30 pages.

## 2016 The decision

The decision to study game design was made in th mid of 2016.
I was quite short and already missed the application times for the state universities.
However, a private university is always happy to welcome you, if you throw some money at them.
Sadly I was even too late for a scholarship which would have been possible with my references.

What my reference was?
My Minecraft server of course!
I put those pages to good use.

## 2016 My pc dies

Finally, after serving me many years, my pc died. It even did a last flash before my PSU died, taking the mainboard and
cpu with it as well.
Fond of my new learned skills and since I wanted to become a programmer, building my own pc couldn't be so hard, right?
And well it worked quite well!
Beside ordering the wrong graphics card and buying a cpu cooler which didn't fit on my memory everything worked fine.
And so my first own pc was born!

## 2016 Start of my studies
And so my game design studies started.
At first not even a single line to program.
All we did was calculating some stuff like bits to decimal and hexadecimal and some very basic stuff.
But finally the day came, and we started using: [Java Kara](https://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/javakara/). 
It is basically a bug solving mazes. Not really something special, but probably challenging enough already.

## 2016 The game designer apartment
I started to share an apartment with 3 other people from my course.
This was the beginning of a lot of night where we finished assignments and also ranted about games and other stuff.

## 2017 More programming!
From there on we moved over to c# and [AntMe](http://www.antme.net/en/).
Programming an ant swarm in c# was already more interesting.
Soon we switched over to unity, programmed our first game of life, like every good student probably did at some point.

## 2017 Start at the golden M
Soon I noticed that my live expenses cant keep up with my income.
I chose the way of least effort and applied at the big burger company with the golden M.
I got accepted.
I didn't know I would spend the next 2,5 years there and completely ruin my private life and sleep schedule.

## 2017 The first game
Every semester had project weeks at the end of the semester.
Groups were formed which then developed games.
You then work on the game for 3 or 6 weeks on that project.
Preferable 5 full days per week.
For me that meant 9-17 at the university and two 4 hour shifts (18-22) during the week and one during the weekend normally.
My first game was a hot seat card game in unity.
It turned out to be quite some fun and even the game itself was quite bug free.
Sadly I dont have a video of it anymore :c
I also 

## 2018 Time of AI
It ain't much, but the AI module was probably the most interesting.
I implemented a basic shortest path AI, which I happen to also have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px4idG80V6Y) off in the depth of my youtube channel.

## 2018 Trying to quit the golden M

I wanted to quit my job since it greatly interfered with my social, private and university life.
However, a week before I wanted to quit, I got the offer to become a shift lead instead.
Resulting in not less work, but better payment and a more predictable work schedule.
So yeah I continued working there...

## 2018 Teddy vs Nightmares
Another university project.
While the title contained nightmare, the project itself was a nightmare too.
We decided to work with unreal and perforce.
We greatly underestimated the whole scope of our project for three weeks.
Additionally, we decided to work with unreal engine 4 for the first time, which we didn't use much to none in the past.
In the end it was [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klureI7VMps), but it wasn't that great.
In the meantime I also went to the shiftleader course.

## 2018 The Internship
