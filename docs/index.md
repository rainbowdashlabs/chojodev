# Welcome

Welcome on my portfolio page.
You can find all various information about [myself](about_me/index.md), the [languages and technologies](about_me/technologies.md) I use.
Or read something about my [minecraft](minecraft/index.md) projects, the [discord bots](discord/index.md) I developed or the [libraries](libraries/index.md) I maintain.
I also have some [other](more/index.md) projects I work on, which do not fit in any of those categories.

**All the work you can find on my pages is available for free.
If you want to support my work consider subscribing on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/eldoriaplugins) or sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rainbowdashlabs)**

Have fun exploring my little page c:
