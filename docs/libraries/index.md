# Libraries

I developed several libraries, which I use for own projects, but also developed with others in mind.

[Jackson Bukkit](jackson_bukkit.md) is a library using jackson to serialize spigot and paper objects.

[SADU](sadu.md) is my SQL library, which I use to avoid a lot of boilerplate code, when sending and reading requests from a database. 
It was also written with novice developers in mind, making it easier for them to work and avoid common pitfalls.

[Universalis Java](universalis_java.md) is a library for requesting crowdsourced market board data of the game [Final Fantasy XIV](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/) from [Universalis](https://universalis.app/).
It also contains a websocket implementation, allowing to subscribe to receive realtime updates from universalis.
