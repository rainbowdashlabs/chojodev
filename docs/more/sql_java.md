# SQL Java Tutorial

At the end of 2020 I wrote a forum post on [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/480002/) about database connections in java.
A few month later I wrote an even larger [post](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/501928/), which aims to educate pure beginners and starts with more basics.
It also contains a lot of other useful information.
Eventually the forum post replaced the [spigot wiki](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/connecting-to-databases-mysql/) page for connecting to a mariadb and mysql database.

Since I wasn't still satisfied with this now very, very long post and wanted to restructure, rephrase and add more information I started my new page, which can be found at [sql.chojo.de](https://sql.chojo.de).
This page picks up what the forum posts were describing and adds additional information to it.
